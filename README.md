## About
I am using this to practice node and express.
[Uses Netflix Roulette API](https://market.mashape.com/community/netflix-roulette)

Ever wonder which movies (on netflix) an actor is in? Wonder no more!
Search your favorite actors and see which movies they are in, their average rating,
and similar actors!

## Install
```
npm install
node index.js
```

## TODO
- [ ] Calculate mean of ratings
- [ ] Find related actors
- [ ] Break up files (currently a mega file)
- [ ] Link movies to Netflix
- [ ] Add Styles
- [ ] Change Front End Language
