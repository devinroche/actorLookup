# Actor Lookup

## About
I am using this to practice node and express.
[Uses Netflix Roulette API](https://market.mashape.com/community/netflix-roulette)

Ever wonder which movies (on netflix) an actor is in? Wonder no more!
Search your favorite actors and see which movies they are in, their average rating,
and similar actors!
